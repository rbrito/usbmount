  [Rafael Laboissiere]
  * debian/control:
    - Bumped Standards-Version to 3.7.2 (no changes needed)
    - Moved debhelper and cdbs from Build-Depends-Indep to Build-Depends,

  * Orphaning package, setting maintainer to Debian QA Group.

 -- Martin Dickopp <martin@zero-based.org>  Sat, 27 Jan 2007 12:42:44 +0100

usbmount (0.0.14-0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-Maintainer Upload
  * Change path of vol_id of udev to the new location in /lib/udev. Thanks to
    Eric Evans for the patch (Closes: #361351)

      that location

 -- Jeroen van Wolffelaar <jeroen@wolffelaar.nl>  Sun, 30 Apr 2006 23:45:57 +0000

usbmount (0.0.14) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upload sponsored by Rafael Laboissiere.
  * Make sure that /etc/dev.d/block/usbmount.dev is removed when the
    package is purged.

 -- Martin Dickopp <martin@zero-based.org>  Sun, 10 Jul 2005 22:17:00 +0200

usbmount (0.0.13) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Upload sponsored by Rafael Laboissiere.
  * Adapt to udev changes: 'udev_volume_id' has been renamed to
    'vol_id' and its output has changed (closes: #317022). Depend on
    udev (>= 0.060-1). Without this change, usbmount doesn't work at
    all with udev 0.060, therefore urgency=medium.
  * New section about the vfat filesystem type added to the README file
    (closes: #316758).
  * /etc/dev.d is obsolete. Remove /etc/dev.d/block/usbmount.dev; the
    usbmount script is now called by the new file /etc/udev/usbmount.rules.
    Create symlink /etc/udev/rules.d/z60_usbmount.rules to this file if
    usbmount is freshly installed or updated from a version before 0.0.13.

 -- Martin Dickopp <martin@zero-based.org>  Fri,  8 Jul 2005 19:22:10 +0200

  * Upload sponsored by Rafael Laboissiere.
  * debian/control: update 'Standards-Version' to 3.6.2. No changes to the
    package necessary.
  * Search additional files in the /sys filesystem for vendor and model
    name (closes: #315192).

 -- Martin Dickopp <martin@zero-based.org>  Fri,  1 Jul 2005 19:11:44 +0200

usbmount (0.0.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upload sponsored by Rafael Laboissiere.
  * If a device is not readable, wait up to 20 seconds for it to become
    so (closes: #305672). Some devices apparently need a few seconds
    initialization time before they can be accessed. Thanks to Peter
    Stelmachovic for his help with debugging this issue.

 -- Martin Dickopp <martin@zero-based.org>  Mon,  2 May 2005 14:19:15 +0200

usbmount (0.0.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upload sponsored by Rafael Laboissiere.
  * When a partition (as opposed to a partition-less device) is mounted,
    an underscore and the partition number are appended to the model name
    symlink.
  * The model name symlink now includes the vendor if known.
  * Acquire lock before 'udev_volume_id' is called. This causes the
    partitions (on a device with more than one partition) to be mounted in
    the right order.
  * Fixed typos in log messages.
  * Run hook scripts when a device or partition is mounted or unmounted
    (closes: #303562). Describe how to use this feature in the README file.
  * Moved /etc/usbmount.conf to /etc/usbmount/usbmount.conf.
  * Moved deletion of mount points in /media from prerm to postrm. Delete
    them not only when the package is removed, but also when installing is
    aborted.
  * Moved creation and deletion of model name symlinks to hook scripts.

 -- Martin Dickopp <martin@zero-based.org>  Tue, 12 Apr 2005 17:45:51 +0200

usbmount (0.0.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upload sponsored by Rafael Laboissiere.
  * When a device is removed, make sure that only the corresponding model
    symlink in /var/run/usbmount is removed (closes: #303376).
  * Include directory /var/run/usbmount in package instead of creating it
    in postinst (closes: #303434).
  * Move creation of mount points in /media from 'postinst configure' to
    'preinst install'. This ensures that the mount points are created if
    the package is removed (but not purged) and then reinstalled.

 -- Martin Dickopp <martin@zero-based.org>  Wed,  6 Apr 2005 23:54:53 +0200

usbmount (0.0.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upload sponsored by Rafael Laboissiere (closes: #298526).
  * Filesystem type specific mount options can be specified.
  * Use locking to serialize concurrent mount attempts. This ensures that
    different mount points are chosen if a device contains more than one
    mountable partition.
  * Make sure that /var/run/usbmount is removed on package removal.
  * More detailed package description and README file.

 -- Martin Dickopp <martin@zero-based.org>  Sun,  3 Apr 2005 23:40:25 +0200

  Rafael Laboissiere:

  * NMU in the behalf of the upstream maintainer, which is also the
    effective maintainer of the Debian package.

  Martin Dickopp:

  * Built as a Debian-native package again.
  * Default configuration does not mount vfat filesystems any more.
  * Put warning in configuration file that sync-mounting is not fully
    implemented for vfat filesystem.
  * Package description refers to new location of the homepage
    (http://usbmount.alioth.debian.org/).

 -- Martin Dickopp <martin@zero-based.org>  Wed,  9 Mar 2005 14:10:34 +0100

usbmount (0.0.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
    - Changed maintainer's email address from <martin-deb@zero-based.org>
      to <martin@zero-based.org>.
    - Create symlink in /var/run/usbmount instead of /var/usbmount. If the
      directory /var/run/usbmount does not exist, it is created when a device
      is plugged in.
  * Updated package description to mention that symlinks in
    /var/run/usbmount are created.
  * Removed instructions for 'reportbug' to send bug reports to the upstream

usbmount (0.0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Create /media if it doesn't already exist.
