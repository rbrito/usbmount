USBmount
--------

The USBmount package automatically mounts USB mass storage devices
(typically USB pens) when they are plugged in, and unmounts them when
they are removed. The mountpoints (/media/usb[0-7] by default),
filesystem types to consider, and mount options are configurable. When
multiple devices are plugged in, the first available mountpoint is
automatically selected. If the device provides a model name, a symbolic
link /var/run/usbmount/MODELNAME pointing to the mountpoint is auto-
matically created.

The script that does the (un)mounting is called by the udev daemon.
Therefore, USBmount requires a 2.6 (or newer) kernel.

USBmount is intended as a lightweight solution which is independent of a
desktop environment. Users which would like an icon to appear when an
USB device is plugged in should use the pmount and hal packages instead.

The comments in the configuration file /etc/usbmount.conf describe how
to configure the package.
